# ESP32-OS v0.1.0-alpha
ESP32-OS was originally developed by Panos Vasilopoulos (a.k.a. SonapSav) in 2022 as "proof of concept" for the Espressif's MCU ESP32. The software was created to provide a pseudo operational system to control and operate the ESP32 devices due to their limited capabilities to act as an OS host.

As such, ESP32-OS releases the MCU from the necessary "processor-hungry" and "memory-hungry" functions of the OS and transfers the burden to the user's browser.

ESP32-OS supports and requires the installation of an SD card for additional storage. As such, the developer suggests the installation of the software on the ESP32-CAM device installed with an SD Card of up to 32GB storage.
